- implement websockets to show messages in realtime
- implement user authentication 
  - storing read messages on the backend (works on different devices)
  - admins can send more direct messages by role, department, or directly to the user by id
  - more message types where the user can vote, respond, RVSP...
- use notification API to show the message
- optimize state updates (update state only if there are new messages)
    - update the api only to return new messages (store last call time locally)
